## Introduction

 Programme using pure javaScript and minimal bootstrap to create ,edit and filter item list.
    

## Future Direction

  Right now, the Item List Manager does not use local storage. However, if we could integrate local storage item list will not deleted when we reload the page.
  Will also add feature to add title and description.
